## Website owner business goals

The reason for creating this website is to help provide some entertiment users. Page owner can present their memory game. Also, this website is an extraordinary platform made to get away from the stress of the day and also to strengthen the memory. 

## User goals

### New user goals

* Basically for a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily see the purpose of the game and easily learn how to play. 

* As a first time visitor, I would like to choose the right  colour tone(I prefer light colours) that are not tire out eyes and start easy to play.

## Structure of the website

The Magic game  is designed to be simple and user-friendly on all types of devices. On desktop, tablet, or mobile device there should be no difference for a user to have a great experience. All parts are designed to concentrate maximum user satisfaction. Users will get some interaction from the interface as links and buttons will have a hover effect.

## Wireframes

I used this website Balsamiq to create  wireframes.

### Colors

Main colours used in a project:
* background color: rgba(197, 228, 211, 0.952)
* font color: rgb(161, 203, 216);
* other colors: rgb(163, 192, 163), rgb(117, 143, 117), black, whitesmoke

### Fonts
* I generally used Oswald for the body. The reason why I chose these fonts is that my page is more tidy and does not tire the eyes while looking at my page. 

### Images
* I used images from [Pixel.com](https://www.pexels.com/)) and there are credited in [credits](#credits) section.
